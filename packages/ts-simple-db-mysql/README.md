# Simple Db, MySQL

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around the `mysql2` library_

This package provides a light wrapper around mysql2 that enforces conformity
with the `SimpleSqlDbInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/kael-shipman/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/master/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).
See that package for information about the interface.
